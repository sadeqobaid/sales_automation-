# Sales Automation System - Implementation Progress

## Completed Components

### 1. Development Environment Setup
- Basic directory structure created
- Python virtual environment configured
- Backend dependencies installed (FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, etc.)
- PostgreSQL database installed
- Development tools configured
- Initial configuration files created

### 2. Database Connection Layer
- Database connection module implemented
- Connection pooling configured for optimal performance
- Database migration tools setup with Alembic
- Database initialization scripts created

### 3. Core Models Implementation
- Base model class created with common fields and methods
- User and authentication models implemented:
  - User model with authentication and profile information
  - Role and Permission models for authorization
  - AuditLog model for security tracking
- Contact management models implemented:
  - Contact model for storing contact information
  - Company model for organization data
  - Tag model for categorization
  - ContactActivity model for interaction tracking
- Lead management models implemented:
  - Lead model for sales lead tracking
  - Opportunity model for sales pipeline
  - Activity tracking models for leads and opportunities
- Marketing campaign models implemented:
  - MarketingCampaign model for campaign management
  - CampaignActivity model for tracking campaign interactions
  - CampaignMetric model for measuring campaign performance

### 4. Repository Layer Implementation
- Base repository with generic CRUD operations
- User-related repositories (User, Role, Permission, AuditLog)
- Contact-related repositories (Contact, Company, Tag, ContactActivity)
- Lead-related repositories (Lead, LeadActivity, Opportunity, OpportunityActivity)
- Marketing-related repositories (MarketingCampaign, CampaignActivity, CampaignMetric)

## Current Status
The foundation of the Sales Automation System has been established with the core models and repositories implemented. These components provide the data structure and data access layer for the system, following best practices for database security and operations.

## Next Steps
1. Develop API endpoints for all core functionality
2. Implement security features including authentication, authorization, and encryption
3. Create user interface components
4. Setup automated processes for background tasks
5. Create comprehensive test documentation
6. Complete system documentation

## Technical Details
- **Backend Framework**: FastAPI
- **ORM**: SQLAlchemy
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Authentication**: JWT-based with role-based access control
- **Migration Tool**: Alembic

## Security Features
- Role-based access control
- Comprehensive audit logging
- Password hashing and security
- Account locking mechanism for failed login attempts
- Token-based authentication with expiration

## Database Design
The database schema follows best practices with:
- Proper relationships between entities
- Audit fields (created_at, updated_at, created_by, updated_by)
- Soft deletion support (is_active flag)
- Comprehensive indexing strategy
